# Tableau Gold WorldofWarcraft WorldValue
The goal of this project was to practice data visualization with Tableau using a dataset of my choice.

# Collecting the data
I choosed a dataset from twitter containing information about the historical value of the World of Warcraft Token. (available here: https://twitter.com/wowtokens?lang=en).

I also needed other data that i found on : https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/

# Preparing the data
The main dataset required some date conversion from Epoch.
I had to use a json editor to get needed values from different websites.

# Visualization in Tableau
My visualizations can be found in Tableau Public here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/ryukeno#!/vizhome/WowTokenprice/Story1?publish=yes

I included the following in my story:

- Wow Token Historical Price
- Average Monthly Salary converted to World of Warcraft gold Value
- Hours needed to play to reach the monthly salary assuming a player does 17000 gold / hours
- Exchange rates
- Transactions including the time you would have to play in order to be able to buy common goods in real life with world of warcraft gold
- Prices of Alchemy Flasks on the Auctions House and quantity
